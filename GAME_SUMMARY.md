## 🚀 Running the Game

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python app.py

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)
- `/` - Serves the HTML page
- `/api/new-game?theme=<theme>` - Returns shuffled cards for selected theme
- Fetches data from SWAPI and PokeAPI when needed
- Caches API responses to improve performance

### Frontend (Vanilla JS)
- Manages game state (flipped cards, matches, moves)
- Handles card click events and flip logic
- Implements match detection with 500ms delay for matches, 1000ms for mismatches
- Updates UI dynamically
- Shows win modal when all pairs are matched

### Styling (CSS)
- CSS Grid for card layout (4x4 grid)
- CSS animations for card flips and matches
- Responsive design with media queries
- Modal overlay for win state

## 🎯 Game Logic

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Fetch 8 items from selected theme
   - Duplicate items to create pairs (16 cards total)
   - Shuffle array randomly

2. **Flip Mechanic**:
   - Allow flipping only when `canFlip === true`
   - Prevent flipping already matched or currently flipped cards
   - Track up to 2 flipped cards at a time

3. **Match Detection**:
   - After 2 cards are flipped, compare their values
   - If match: mark as matched, increment counter
   - If no match: flip back after 1 second
   - Disable flipping during comparison

4. **Win Condition**:
   - Check if `matchedPairs === 8`
   - Display modal with move count
   - Allow starting new game
